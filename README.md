**Reflection**
The goal with regard to my course is to equip myself with the necessary skills and knowledge that will come in handy in a real-world situation. I am eager to learn new technologies and ideas so that I can play a key role in preventing cyberattacks in the future. Design thinking allows me to enhance my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. I can detect the possible problems faced by people and think creatively to resolve them. With these skills, I can be more aware of cyber threats nowadays and analyze complex situations effectively. To strengthen my skills, I will try to keep up with the latest technology trends by participating in different workshops, talks, or even competitions. Staying open to continuous learning and improvement gives me more opportunities in the industry and enhances my marketability.
